      Welcome to my page! My name is Eli LeWitt and I currently reside in Chicago, Illinois. Originally, I was born in Detroit, Michigan, where I lived until I was 21. After graduating from the University of Michigan, I moved to California, where I graduated from the University of San Diego School of Law. For the past few years, I've been working as an attorney in FinTech space, mostly for companies in the blockchain tech/ crypto space.
